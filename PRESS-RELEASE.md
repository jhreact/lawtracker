## Law Tracker ##

## Making the legislative process open for citizens and colaborative for policy makers ##

## Summary ##
  Law Tracker helps legislators, congressional staff and citizens to streamline the process 
  of writing and tracking changes to legislation. Before a bill becomes a law, it will have
  undergone a usually lengthy and complicated process of negotiation that frequently results
  in a significant divergence between the initial and final versions of bills. Currently,
  keeping track of the significant changes to a particular bill requires an excellent
  eye for detail and a lot of patient reading.  Legislative stakeholders and the public
  deserve a simpler way to follow changes to congressional legislation during a bill's 
  lifecycle. LawTracker is an open source software tool that allows regular citizens to 
  collaborate in the legislative process by suggesting changes to congressional legislation 
  and transparently tracking changes made to bills during the legislative lifecycle.

## Problem ##
  The legislative process has long been quite obscure, with changes to bills made during
  a lengthy, complicated process of negotiation that is very difficult for average 
  citizens to follow.  Identifying changes made to legislation before a bill becomes law
  is a supremely laborious task that requires reading potentially hundreds of pages of 
  proposed legislation in close detail.  Additionally, there is no convenient mechanism 
  for private citizens to meaningfully contribute or suggest changes to proposed 
  legislation.  Since it is difficult to identify precisely the changes made to proposed 
  bills during the legislative lifecycle, the bill-writing process has become very opaque.  

## Solution ##
  LawTracker provides an innovative solution to the problem of understanding changes made
  to bills during the legislative process. The software industry has developed sophisticated
  tools to deal with a similar challenge, the need to control precisely the changes between 
  software versions.  The goal of this project is to take one of these distributed version 
  control systems, called Git, and use it to control changes to bills in the legislative 
  process. LawTracker is open-source software that allows citizens and lawmakers to 
  collaborate in the legislative process. The implementation of industry-standard 
  version-control software to the legislative process will allow legislators, stakeholders 
  and citizens to understand and see with ease all changes, large and small, made to a bill 
  before it becomes a law.  Additionally, citizens will be able to use our convenient web 
  interface to propose changes to laws and to propose their own legislation.    

## Quote from You ##
  "LawTracker use sophisticated, open-source software tools to track changes made to 
  proposed bills in the legislative lifecycle, as well as propose improvements to pending
  bills. It will empower citizens by bringing greatly needed transparency to the process
  of lawmaking."  --James Williams, Law Tracker core developer

## How to Get Started ##
  To get started, create new user account and submit a new proposed bill.  Users can edit
  bills and the software will automatically keep track of all changes made to the 
  legislation.  Collaborators can propose changes to any bill and propose their own 
  legislation based on another bill.
