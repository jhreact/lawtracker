      <h2> Colloborative policy-making </h2>
      <p>  Law Tracker helps legislators, congressional staff and citizens to streamline the process 
  of writing and tracking changes to legislation. Before a bill becomes a law, it will have
  undergone a usually lengthy and complicated process of negotiation that frequently results
  in a significant divergence between the initial and final versions of bills. Currently,
  keeping track of the significant changes to a particular bill requires an excellent
  eye for detail and a lot of patient reading. </p>

      <h2> Follow changes in the law </h2>
      <p>Legislative stakeholders and the public deserve a simpler way to follow changes to congressional legislation during a bill's lifecycle.  The implementation of industry-standard 
  version-control software to the legislative process will allow legislators, stakeholders 
  and citizens to understand and see with ease all changes, large and small, made to a bill 
  before it becomes a law.  Additionally, citizens will be able to use our convenient web 
  interface to propose changes to laws and to propose their own legislation.   </p>
